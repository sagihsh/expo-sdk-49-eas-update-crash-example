## How to run
- Just run `npm i` to install deps, then run `npm start`

## How to reproduce the issue?
- The project runs fine locally, but when you make a new EAS update and then try to open that update using the Expo Go app, it crashes on start on iOS or hangs in 'New update available, downloading...' on Android.
